> The libp2p swarm manages groups of connections to peers, and handles incoming and outgoing streams.

The libp2p swarm is the 'low level' interface for working with a given libp2p
network. It gives you more fine grained control over various aspects of the
system. Most applications don't need this level of access, so the `Swarm` is
generally wrapped in a `Host` abstraction that provides a more friendly
interface. See [the host interface](https://godoc.org/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-core/host#Host)
for more info on that.

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm
```

## Usage

### Creating a swarm

To construct a swarm, you'll be calling `NewSwarm`. That function looks like this:
```go
swarm, err := NewSwarm(peerID, peerstore)
```

The first parameter of the swarm constructor is an identity in the form of a peer.ID.

The second argument is a peerstore. This is essentially a database that the
swarm will use to store peer IDs, addresses, public keys, protocol preferences
and more.

### Streams
The swarm is designed around using multiplexed streams to communicate with
other peers. When working with a swarm, you will want to set a function to
handle incoming streams from your peers:

```go
swrm.SetStreamHandler(func(s network.Stream) {
	defer s.Close()
	fmt.Println("Got a stream from: ", s.SwarmConn().RemotePeer())
	fmt.Fprintln(s, "Hello Friend!")
})
```

Tip: Always make sure to close streams when you're done with them.
