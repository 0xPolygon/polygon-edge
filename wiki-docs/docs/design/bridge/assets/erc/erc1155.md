ERC-1155 is a token standard that enables the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens on a blockchain network. In the context of Edge, ERC-1155 tokens can be used to represent multiple instances of a single fungible or non-fungible asset on an Edge-powered chain.

## ChildERC1155

Developers can use the [`ChildERC1155`](../../../../interfaces/erc1155/childerc1155.md) token standard to create ERC-1155 tokens on an Edge-powered chain. To create a new ChildERC1155 token, developers can use the `ChildERC1155` contract as a template and deploy it on the Edge-powered chain. The contract requires a name and symbol to determine the unique identity of the token.

Once created, `ChildERC1155` tokens can be minted and burned on the Edge-powered chain through the corresponding ERC1155Predicate contract. This ensures that the supply of tokens on the rootchain and the Edge-powered chain remains in sync. The `ERC1155Predicate` contract also allows for the transfer of tokens between the two.

## Predicates

The [`RootERC1155Predicate`](../../../../interfaces/erc1155/rooterc1155-predicate.md) contract serves as the root token contract, while the [`ChildERC1155Predicate`](../../../../interfaces/erc1155/childerc1155-predicate.md) contract serves as the child token contract. When a user wants to deposit an ERC-1155 token on the rootchain into the Edge-powered chain, they call the deposit function on the `RootERC1155Predicate` contract with the appropriate parameters, including the token ID, sender, and receiver addresses.

Once the child contract instance is created, the `RootERC1155Predicate` contract maps the root token to the child token using a mapping, allowing users to deposit and withdraw tokens between the root and Edge-powered chain. The ChildERC1155Predicate contract includes functions for minting and burning child tokens, which are triggered when the deposit and withdrawal functions are called.

To withdraw a child token back to the rootchain, a user calls the appropriate function on the ChildERC1155Predicate contract with the necessary parameters, including the token ID, the amount to withdraw, and the receiver address. The `ChildERC1155Predicate` contract then burns the child token and emits a withdrawal event. The `RootERC1155Predicate` contract listens for these events and relays them to the rootchain using the `L2StateSender` contract.

## Deposits and Withdrawals

Depositing and withdrawing ERC-1155 tokens between the rootchain and Edge-powered chain can be done using the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions in the `RootERC1155Predicate` and `ChildERC1155Predicate` contracts, respectively. The `ChildERC1155Predicate` contract includes functions for minting and burning child tokens, which are triggered when the deposit and withdrawal functions are called. To withdraw a child token back to the rootchain, a user calls the appropriate function on the `ChildERC1155Predicate` contract with the necessary parameters, including the token ID, the amount to withdraw, and the receiver address. The `ChildERC1155Predicate` contract then burns the child token and emits a withdrawal event.
