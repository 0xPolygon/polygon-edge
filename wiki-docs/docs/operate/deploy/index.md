This serves as an index for the Edge deployment guides. 
The guides explain the end-to-end process for setting up and deploying a local Edge-powered chain.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into any of the tutorials, make sure your environment meets the necessary prerequisites. They can be found **[<ins>here</ins>](/operate/system)**.

### Before starting

!!! info "Don't use the develop branch for deployments"

      Please ensure that you are not running on the `develop` branch, which is the active development branch and include changes that are still being tested and not compatible with the current process.

      Instead, use the [<ins>latest release</ins>](/operate/install) for deployments.

!!! caution "Key management and secure values"
      When passing values, it is important to keep sensitive values like private keys and API keys secure.

      <b>The sample commands provided in this guide use sample private keys for demonstration purposes only, in order to show the format and expected value of the parameter. It is important to note that hardcoding or directly passing private keys should never be done in a development or production environment.</b>

!!! info
      Here are some options for securely storing and retrieving private keys ↓</summary>

      - **<ins>Environment Variables</ins>:** You can store the private key as an environment variable and access it in your code. For example, in Linux, you can set an environment variable like this: `export PRIVATE_KEY="my_private_key"`. Then, in your code, you can retrieve the value of the environment variable using `os.Getenv("PRIVATE_KEY")`.

      - **<ins>Configuration Files</ins>:** You can store the private key in a configuration file and read it in your session. Be sure to keep the configuration file in a secure location and restrict access to it.

      - **<ins>Vaults and Key Management Systems</ins>:** If you are working with sensitive data, you might consider using a vault or key management system like a keystore to store your private keys. These systems provide additional layers of security and can help ensure that your private keys are kept safe.

      </details>

Regardless of how a private key is stored and retrieved, it's important to keep it secure and not expose it unnecessarily.


## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and initialize an Edge-powered chain with multiple nodes. You will learn the complete end-to-end genesis workflow of building an Edge-powered chain, including:

- Generating private keys for PolyBFT nodes.
- Deploying and initializing rootchain contracts.
- Configuring the rootchain by allowlisting and registering validators, performing initial staking, and finalizing the validator set.
- Generating the genesis file and chain configuration.
- Funding validators on the rootchain.
- Running an (Edge) cluster consisting of multiple PolyBFT nodes.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional Edge test network that can be used to process transactions with high throughput and low latency.

## What you'll do

The deployment guides will cover the steps outlined below. If you are deploying an Edge-powered chain for the first time, please navigate each section in order. 

1. [<ins>Spawn a New Edge-powered chain</ins>](/operate/deploy/local-chain)
2. [<ins>Configure Your New Edge-powered chain</ins>](/operate/deploy/genesis)
3. [<ins>Configure the Rootchain</ins>](/operate/deploy/rootchain-config)
4. [<ins>Configure the Initial Validator Set</ins>](/operate/deploy/genesis-validators)
5. [<ins>Start Your New Edge-powered chain</ins>](/operate/deploy/start-chain)

<summary>Fast-track guide ↓</summary>

**Here's the fast-track guide if you're looking for a quick guide on the essential commands needed to set up a local Edge-powered chain.**

1. Init secrets:

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge polybft-secrets --data-dir test-chain- --num 4
   ```

2. Create chain configuration:

   Single host:

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge genesis --block-gas-limit 10000000 --epoch-size 10 [--validators-path ./] [--validators-prefix test-chain-] [--consensus polybft] [--reward-wallet address:amount]

   Multi-host:

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge genesis --block-gas-limit 10000000 --epoch-size 10 --validators /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30301/p2p/16Uiu2HAmV5hqAp77untfJRorxqKmyUxgaVn8YHFjBJm9gKMms3mr:0xDcBe0024206ec42b0Ef4214Ac7B71aeae1A11af0:1cf134e02c6b2afb2ceda50bf2c9a01da367ac48f7783ee6c55444e1cab418ec0f52837b90a4d8cf944814073fc6f2bd96f35366a3846a8393e3cb0b19197cde23e2b40c6401fa27ff7d0c36779d9d097d1393cab6fc1d332f92fb3df850b78703b2989d567d1344e219f0667a1863f52f7663092276770cf513f9704b5351c4:11b18bde524f4b02258a8d196b687f8d8e9490d536718666dc7babca14eccb631c238fb79aa2b44a5a4dceccad2dd797f537008dda185d952226a814c1acf7c2]
   ```

3. Deploy and initialize rootchain contracts:

   [FOR GETH ONLY] Start rootchain server:

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge rootchain server
   ```

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge rootchain deploy --deployer-key <hex_encoded_rootchain_account_private_key> [--genesis ./genesis.json] [--json-rpc http://127.0.0.1:8545] [--test]
   ```

4. Fund validators on rootchain:

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge rootchain fund --data-dir ./test-chain-1
   ```

5. Allowlist validators on rootchain:

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge polybft whitelist-validators --private-key <hex_encoded_rootchain_account_private_key_of_supernetManager_deployer> --addresses <addresses_of_validators> --supernet-manager <address_of_SupernetManager_contract>
   ```

6. Register validators on rootchain:

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge polybft register-validator --data-dir ./test-chain-1 --supernet-manager <address_of_SupernetManager_contract>
   ```

7. Initial staking on rootchain:

   ```bash
   ./polygon-edge polybft stake --data-dir ./test-chain-1 --chain-id <id_of_child_chain_from_genesis> --amount <amount_of_tokens_to_stake> --stake-manager <address_of_StakeManager_contract> --native-root-token <address_of_native_root_token>
   ```

8. Finalize genesis validator set on rootchain:

   ```bash
    ./polygon-edge polybft supernet --private-key <hex_encoded_rootchain_account_private_key_of_supernetManager_deployer> \
    --genesis <path_to_genesis_file> \
    --supernet-manager <address_of_SupernetManager_contract> \
    --stake-manager <address_of_StakeManager_contract> \
    --finalize-genesis --enable-staking
   ```

9. Run (child chain) cluster:

    ```bash
    ./polygon-edge server --data-dir ./test-chain-1 --chain genesis.json --grpc-address :5001 --libp2p :30301 --jsonrpc :10001 \
    --seal --log-level DEBUG

    ./polygon-edge server --data-dir ./test-chain-2 --chain genesis.json --grpc-address :5002 --libp2p :30302 --jsonrpc :10002 \
    --seal --log-level DEBUG

    ./polygon-edge server --data-dir ./test-chain-3 --chain genesis.json --grpc-address :5003 --libp2p :30303 --jsonrpc :10003 \
    --seal --log-level DEBUG

    ./polygon-edge server --data-dir ./test-chain-4 --chain genesis.json --grpc-address :5004 --libp2p :30304 --jsonrpc :10004 \
    --seal --log-level DEBUG
    ```

    Starting node in relayer mode:

    ```bash
    ./polygon-edge server --data-dir ./test-chain-1 --chain genesis.json --grpc-address :5001 --libp2p :30301 --jsonrpc :10001 \
    --seal --log-level DEBUG --relayer
    ```
