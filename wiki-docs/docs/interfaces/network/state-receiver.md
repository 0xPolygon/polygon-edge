The `IStateReceiver` interface is designed to handle state updates received from a higher-level entity, typically on the L2 side of the childchain. This user guide will explain how to interact with the functions provided by the `IStateReceiver` interface.

## Functions

### onStateReceive()

This function is called when the contract receives a state update. It processes the incoming state, allowing the contract to react to changes in the higher-level state.

#### Parameters

- `counter` (uint256): A counter value associated with the state update.
- `sender` (address): The entity's address sending the state update.
- `data` (bytes): The calldata associated with the state update.

#### Usage

To handle a state update in your contract, you must implement the onStateReceive() function. The higher-level entity will call this function when a state update is sent.

For example, you might implement onStateReceive() as follows:

```solidity
contract MyStateReceiver is IStateReceiver {
    function onStateReceive(uint256 counter, address sender, bytes calldata data) external override {
        // Process the incoming state update
        // ...
    }
}
```

This function allows your contract to react to state updates, enabling communication between your contract and higher-level state providers. By implementing the `IStateReceiver` interface, you can ensure that your contract stays current with broader ecosystem changes.
